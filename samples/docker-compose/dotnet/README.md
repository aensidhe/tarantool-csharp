# Welcome to ASP.NET Core demo of Tarantool.CSharp

We've made this demo to demonstrate that out client work in asp.net core docker, hence in linux.

This code is not supposed to be used in production environment due to lack of error handling and dumping stacktraces on the homepage of site.

Project generated by [asp.net core scaffolding](https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/tutorials/your-first-mac-aspnet.html) and reduced to minimum to demonstrate Tarantool client capabilities.
